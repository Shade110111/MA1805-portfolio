A huge warehouse of desk workers worship the clock, since I originally planned to
animate each worker and have their animations offset randomly, each of them is
redrawn every frame like the ticking clock.
To prevent flickering between variations and animating in sync each cubicle has a seed,
a predetermined random number stored within a 2D array. The office changes upon page refresh
and adjusts to the size of your screen.
