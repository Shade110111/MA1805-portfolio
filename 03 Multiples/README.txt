A huge warehouse of desk workers worship the clock, each worker is
redrawn every frame to animate them so they need a consistent seed to keep track of their
animation offset and visual variations which I managed to store in a 2D array.
The office changes upon page refresh and adjusts to the size of your screen.
The idea is that it is easier to study while staring at hundreds of people having a worse time
than you are. Some workers have clocks on different sides of the desk, some have plants or have
different screens, the workers will occasionally sleep and get up startled or swing in their chair,
some workers have dark or light skin or hair.
