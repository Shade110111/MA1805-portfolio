A huge warehouse of desk workers worship the clock, each worker is
redrawn every frame to animate them so they need a consistent seed to keep track of their
animation offset and visual variations which I managed to store in a 2D array.
The office changes upon page refresh and adjusts to the size of your screen.
The idea is that it is easier to study while staring at hundreds of people having a worse time
than you are.
