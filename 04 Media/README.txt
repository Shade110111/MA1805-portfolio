I wanted to make a reactive sketch, the breathing of the machine from some sound assets
I messed with in adobe. Clicking toggles the breathing of the machine, flicking the mouse
left or right triggers quavers and is always followed by triplets, the higher the mouse is
the louder the synths are, it is inkeeping with the ideas of the previous sketches but
focuses on channelling more of the feeling of those spaces than showing them off.
Inkeeping with the projects lonelyness the music will play forever, long after you are gone
if you leave it.
